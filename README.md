# Plex-API-Node-Server
A node server for communicating with the Plex API. I built this to handle API requests for the Plex Cordova client.

The Plex API Node Server has most functionality in place to allow for a relatively full featured client. It handles login, server listing, category listing and content listings, each with the access tokens necessary to handle future requests.
