# Plex-API-Node-Server
A node server for communicating with the Plex API. I built this to handle API requests for the Plex Cordova client.

The Plex API Node Server has most functionality in place to allow for a relatively full featured client. It handles login, server listing, category listing and content listings, each with the access tokens necessary to handle future requests.  

To build and run this successfully. Download and install Node JS. Upon completion, clone repository, enter cloned repository and run the following in command prompt from this folder:

npm install

This will install the project dependancies. once done, in the same command window enter:

node app.js

This will run the plex node server.
